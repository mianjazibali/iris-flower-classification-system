# iris-flower-classification-system
Built a Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch (Using NumPy and SciPy) to predict the iris flower class based on its petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. Achieved ~94% accuracy using the iris dataset obtained from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
